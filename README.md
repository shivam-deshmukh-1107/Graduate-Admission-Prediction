# Graduate Admission Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the chances of graduate admission for prospective students based on various features such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, Statement of Purpose (SOP), Letter of Recommendation (LOR), Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), and Research experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert source here], containing 500 rows and 9 columns. The target variable is "Chance of Admit," representing the likelihood of a student's admission.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the project interactively)
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data visualization and summary statistics are performed to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Distributions of features and the target variable are visualized.
- Relationships between features are explored using scatter plots and regression plots.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values (if any), standardization of specific features (e.g., GRE Score, TOEFL Score), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Modeling
### Linear Regression
- A Linear Regression model is trained to predict graduate admission chances.
- Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, R-squared, MAE) are calculated.
### Decision Tree Regressor
A Decision Tree Regressor model is trained and evaluated for admission prediction.
### Random Forest Regressor
- A Random Forest Regressor model is trained and evaluated.
- Ensemble learning is applied to improve prediction accuracy.
### KNeighbors Regressor
- A KNeighbors Regressor model is trained and evaluated.
- The model uses k-nearest neighbors to make predictions.
### Model Evaluation
- Model performance is evaluated using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE metrics.
- Actual vs. predicted value plots are generated to visualize model performance.
### Feature Importance
- Feature importance is determined using the Random Forest Regressor model.
- Visualizations show the importance of each feature in predicting admission chances.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings of the project, including which model performed best, important features, and potential areas for improvement.
